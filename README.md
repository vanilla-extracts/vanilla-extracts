## Welcome to the _charlotte zone_ !

🖥️ Hello! I'm 22, former student at @univ-rennes1 (ISTIC) in Computer Science after a cycle of two years in _classe préparatoires aux grandes écoles_ 

🧮 I used to work on programming language theory. You can check [calc](https://github.com/coco33920/calc), [Baguette#](https://github.com/coco33920/ocaml-baguettesharp-interpreter), or [STARFinder](https://github.com/co33920/STARFinder) for more information.

In February 2023 I started an internship at IRISA/INRIA Rennes, at the [PACAP Team](https://team.inria.fr/pacap/presentation/), where I worked on [OFast3D](https://project.inria.fr/ofast3d/). This internship ended in July 2023.

My end-of-study internship was in the [EPICURE Team](https://team.inria.fr/epicure/), where I worked on the [back-to-the-trees](https://back-to-the-trees.gitlabpages.inria.fr/plantinator/) project. This internship ended in July 2024.

I am now an IT specialist and a state civil servant.

### My Work
I plan to learn Coq as I continue (and Haskell). I'm actively developing _Baguette#_ (read Baguette Sharp) which is an exotic language with a horrible syntax and where all instruction, basic library, keywords and separators are replaced by names of pastries (mainly French but I ran out of French pastries a while ago)

I also love [calc](https://github.com/vanilla-extracts/calc), which is a calculator programmed in Rust with a Pratt parser method. You can check it out, it's worth an eye :)

### CV

If you want to see more see my [cv (🇫🇷)](https://www.charlotte-thomas.me/static/cv_fr.pdf) or [cv (🇬🇧)](https://www.charlotte-thomas.me/static/cv_en.pdf)

My CVs are typeset using Typst. I love how flexible and powerful Typst is. You should check out their [website](https://typst.app) to become part of the #TypstFamily. I am a proud supporter of their work and one of the most prolific community contributors.

I also have CVs as manpages:
```bash
curl https://www.charlotte-thomas.me/static/cv_en.man | man -l -
```
You can replace `cv_en.man` with `cv_fr.man` for the French translation.
